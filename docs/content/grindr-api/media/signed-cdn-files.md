# Signed CDN files

CDN files accessible via signed URLs signed with `Signature` query argument. New signed URLs are generated and populated in API responses when existing URL expires. `Expires` query argument holds expiration date in unix timestamp in seconds, 15 minutes.

Base URL appears to be: `https://d2wxe7lth7kp8g.cloudfront.net/`

Although it might change in the future, so it's best to pull full URL from `url` property on media object itself.

## Chat media

```
GET /{uploaderProfileId}/{mediaHash}
```

Query:

- `Expires` — integer
- `Signature` — string
- `Key-Pair-Id` — string

Response:

Binary content.
